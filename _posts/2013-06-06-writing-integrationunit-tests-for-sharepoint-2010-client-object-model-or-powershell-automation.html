<p>When I started with SharePoint development I needed to find out the tools for proper testing. Currently I use Nunit and the Resharper Test Runner. If you don't have or know Resharper, which is very unlikely if you read this :-) , you should definetly check it out! Basically I use to methods for my integration and unit tests as you can see below.</p>
<h2>Using the Client Object Model<&#47;h2><br />
SharePoints Client Object Model is the obvious choice for implementing your tests. First you have to reference Assemblies (Microsoft.SharePoint.Client, Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime) in your project. You can find them in:</p>
<pre>%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\14\ISAPI<&#47;pre><br />
The following code illustrates how you can use you ClientContext to get all your SharePoint objects.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; gutter: true">using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client;<br />
using NUnit.Framework;</p>
<p>namespace BetterBlogTemplate.tests<br />
{<br />
   [TestFixture]<br />
   public class IntegrationTest<br />
   {</p>
<p>       [Test]<br />
       public void TestInstallationAndConfigurationOfSharePointObjects()<br />
       {<br />
           string siteUrl = "http:&#47;&#47;SharePoint&#47;";<br />
           ClientContext clientContext = new ClientContext(siteUrl);<br />
           Site siteCollection = clientContext.Site;<br />
           Web web = clientContext.Web;<br />
           Assert.True(web!=null);<br />
           &#47;&#47;I ran this test on a blog sitecollection.<br />
           List beitr&auml;ge = web.Lists.GetByTitle("Beitr&auml;ge");</p>
<p>           &#47;&#47;tell ClientContext what to load.<br />
           clientContext.Load(web);<br />
           clientContext.Load(beitr&auml;ge);<br />
           &#47;&#47;When the query is executed, data is downloaded using sharePoint web services<br />
           clientContext.ExecuteQuery();<br />
           &#47;&#47;Now i can go ahead and test whatever I like<br />
           Assert.NotNull(beitr&auml;ge.Description);<br />
       }</p>
<p>   }<br />
}<&#47;pre><br />
Using this I can write powerful tests using simple tools. I like to write special tests for checking my deployment if I got the time.</p>
<h2>Using Powershell Automation Assembly<&#47;h2><br />
One time I had to add an expiration date to blog posts. To achieve this I used a simple timer job. Since I like to write my tests before coding, I wanted to create a test that would create a few entries, run the timer job and check if everything is deleted correctly. The problem was that I couldn't acess timer jobs through the CSOM. Therefore I needed to find a different way and simply used the dll all the SharePoint&nbsp; Powershell's CmdLets use. This is less restrictive and I could test the behavior of my SPTimerJob. So first reference the Microsoft.SharePoint.Powershell.dll in your project which is usually in the GAC:</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell\14.0.0.0__71e9bce111e9429c\Microsoft.SharePoint.Powershell.dll<&#47;pre><br />
The code is also very easy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; gutter: true"> [Test]<br />
       public void TestInstallationAndConfigurationOfSharePointObjects()<br />
       {<br />
           string siteUrl = "http:&#47;&#47;SharePoint&#47;";<br />
           SPSitePipeBind s= new SPSitePipeBind(siteUrl);</p>
<p>           SPSite test=s.Read();<br />
           System.Console.WriteLine(test.ID);<br />
           string name = "somejobName";<br />
           &#47;&#47;There&#039;s a PipeBind for all your SharePoint objects<br />
           SPTimerJobPipeBind jobPipe= new SPTimerJobPipeBind(name);<br />
           &#47;&#47;Just use the read method and voila! You got your JobDefinition and can run the job<br />
           &#47;&#47;from a test<br />
           SPJobDefinition job= jobPipe.Read();<br />
           Assert.NotNull(job);</p>
<p>       }<&#47;pre><br />
That's it for my SharePoint testing needs so far :-)</p>
